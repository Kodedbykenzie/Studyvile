            <p>
              At Studyvile, it is complusory that all students pay their first semester fees though we have ways that it could be sorted out. The scholarship given last per semester i.e if you get a scholarship after concluding your first semester you will not be expected to pay the fees of next semester. Note Scholarships are awarded to students who perform extra-ordinarily well during the semester. We believe in being dedicated to whatever you plan on doing. Students with good grades will be sent to top tech company both home and abroad to intern, so the higher your grade, the higher your chances.

                 Yes, but there's a catch. Our partners will take some of our trainees as interns in their company but it depends on how well the individual performs. So we can't guarantee that everyone will get an internship placement but with the skill learnt here you can succeed anywhere.
